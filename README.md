# Papaya Networks Segmentation

# Objectives
The work here aims to detect, using UAVs, the ringspot virus present in papaya, using segmentation networks.
In the work, the networks PSPNET, U-NET and LINKNET were used.

# Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow
OpenCV

# Project

The codes submitted here were all used as described in the work. 
Google colab was used using the settings provided in the text of the work.
Each network was trained by combining VGG16 as an encoder and the original networks as a decoder.
